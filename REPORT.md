# BuildZn portfolio report

Built and verified as a synthetic portfolio showcase. Public source: https://github.com/umair24171/sales-call-to-crm-sync. [Successful CI, native database tests and Docker demo](https://github.com/umair24171/sales-call-to-crm-sync/actions/runs/40031451224), code `cc1bc499c73958e810218b9baee00d2c6fd3f8e0`.

30 distinct tests: native PostgreSQL 30 passed, 0 environment-specific skipped; embedded complement 30 passed, 0 environment-specific skipped; zero failed. Every distinct case passed in at least one appropriate environment. Dependency install, formatting, TypeScript, configured full-history secret scan and fresh-checkout Docker demo passed. Real output is in docs/native-ci-output.txt and docs/demo-output.md. No live Claude calls, real customer data, messaging or hosting.

Implementation scope, data model and edge-case contract are in docs/PLAN.md. Policy/identity/transport assumptions and MIT license choice are in docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md. README describes architecture and the remaining production limitations. Initial authoring-host and publishing blockers were resolved by signed-in GitHub creation, narrowly scoped connector access and hosted Actions. No credential was created or printed.

Portfolio pages and the combined website report are in [BuildZn PR #24](https://github.com/umair24171/dev_umair/pull/24). The user approved it and it was merged on 24 October 2026, including four original generated project illustrations. The image revision passed lint, types, 48 unit tests, 22 browser tests and the smoke suite. Website validation and its existing-test limitations are tracked in the PR description. Automatic Git deployments from main and the portfolio branch are disabled; no hosting deployment was performed.

- Invoice to cash agent: Match synthetic invoices and bank lines, retain exceptions, and prepare reminders that require approval.
- Support resolution agent: Resolve synthetic store tickets with guarded refund, address-change and reschedule tools.
- Permission aware knowledge search: Apply current source permissions inside the pgvector query before returning document chunks.
- Sales call to CRM sync: Turn synthetic transcripts into grounded CRM diffs and follow-up drafts, with approval required for every write.

Across the four projects, all 128 distinct cases passed in at least one appropriate environment. Native PostgreSQL passed 127 and skipped the one embedded-only case; the embedded complement passed 126 and skipped the two native-only process-kill cases. Zero failures in the linked verified runs. All four Docker demos ran from fresh checkouts. Data and fixtures are synthetic; live Claude quality and production transport/connector/authentication guarantees remain outside scope. See each repository's README and assumptions.
