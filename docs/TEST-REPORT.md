Tests include unit checks, database integration and adversarial cases. The numbered test names map to the written edge cases in docs/PLAN.md. Full stdout is in docs/test-output.txt. Embedded transactions serialize, so local concurrent-call tests do not prove native lock behavior. Native concurrency and network transport behavior remain unverified.

No tests were deleted or weakened to pass. Assertion normalization, implementation fixes and runtime runner fixes are described in PROGRESS.md and README.md. Source/policy fixture review found no real customer data. A configured credential-pattern scan includes tracked files and historical blobs; it is not a guarantee that all possible secrets are detectable.
